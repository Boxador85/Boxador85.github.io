		<h3 class="title">THE STORY OF AN EVOLUTION</h3>
		<p>The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution (colloquially known as the "Evo") is the Japanese brand’s flagship sports car. Based only on the unibody of the domesticated Lancer sedan the Evo is a rally inspired, turbocharged, all wheel drive, durable and finely tuned automobile. The number designation of the model is most commonly a roman numeral, and is about to turn into </p>

		<p class="extend">1992 Evolution I</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution1.jpg"><img class="index" alt="Lancer_Evolution1.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution1.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>Flush with success from its Galant VR-4 and hungry for WRC victory, Mitsubishi determined in 1990 that further success would require a new platform. To that end, Mitsubishi engineers started with VR-4’s proven drivetrain and shoehorned it into the lighter, smaller Lancer chassis and the Evolution I was born.</p>
		<p>However, competition in WRC’s Group A required the homologation of 2,500 production models. No problem. Offered in GSR and RS flavors, 5,000 EVO Is were snapped up between September 1992 and December 1993. Mitsubishi’s intent behind the lightweight RS model was to provide a good starting point for building a club-level rally car.</p>
		<p>The Evolution I was introduced in 1992 to compete in the World Rally Championship. It used the 2.0 L turbocharged DOHC engine and 4WD drivetrain from the original Galant VR-4 in a Lancer chassis, and was sold in GSR and RS models. The latter was a stripped-down club racing version that lacked power windows and seats, anti-lock brakes, a rear wiper, and had steel wheels to save approximately 155 lb (70 kg) less than the 2730 lb (1238 kg) GSR, while the former came with all of the conveniences of a typical street car. It came with Mitsubishi’s 4G63 engine producing 247 PS (244 hp/182 kW) at 6000 rpm and 228 ft·lbf (309 N·m) at 3000 rpm, along with all wheel drive which would become a trademark on all Evo models. 5,000 Evo Is were sold between 1992 and 1993. Evo I was using the CD9A frame.</p>

		<p class="extend">1993 Evolution II</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution2.jpg"><img class="index" alt="Lancer_Evolution2.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution2.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>The successful Evo I was changed in December of 1993, and the Lancer Evolution II, built from that month to January 1995, was focused primarily on improving the handling of the EVO I. Though the same fundamental chassis was used in Evolutions I-III, EVO II brought a 10 mm increase in wheelbase accomplished by moving the front wheels forward. Vehicle track was increased at both ends to accommodate larger tires (now 205/60-15; up from 195/55-15), while longer control arms in front and a revised sway-bar mounting arrangement enhanced steering response. Aerodynamic tweaks like a front air dam and an additional rear spoiler support improved vehicle stability at higher speeds.</p>
		<p>Mitsubishi intended to improve power output with each Evolution, and EVO II started the trend. Boost pressure was increased, higher-lift cams were fitted, and detail changes to the exhaust reduced backpressure. Power of the 4G63 was now up to 256 bhp, while torque remained unchanged at 228 lb-ft, propelling a vehicle weight of 2,750 pounds for GSR models and 2,600 pounds for RS models. Also, Mitsubishi decided to change the frame this year to CE9A, a spin off the CD9A used in the previous edition.</p>

		<p class="extend">1995 Evolution III</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution3.jpg"><img class="index" alt="Lancer_Evolution3.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution3.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>Speeds on tarmac stages were getting higher, so reducing lift and improving cooling performance became priorities in Evolution III. A larger rear wing, a front airdam with brake cooling vents, and rocker panel extensions were fitted and, you guessed it, power was up again. It arrived in January 1995 and this time the 5000 strong production run was brought up more quickly than the Evo 2. The Evo 3 looked more serious, with it’s new nose moulding (to channel air better to the radiator, intercooler, and brakes). New side skirts and rear corners, while the rear wing had grown again to reduce lift. Under the vented aluminium bonnet a new TDO5-16G6-7 Turbo, new exhaust system and increased compression brought another 10 bhp power rise, Torque output was unaltered, apart from a higher final drive ratio. Both GSR and RS still used the same 5speed gearbox. Interior tweaks were limited to a new Momo steering wheel (GSR only) and new fabric on the Evo 2 type Recaros. This model still uses the same frame. (CE9A)</p>
		<p>Selling 7,000 examples from January 1995 to August 1996, Evolution III was the best-selling EVO to that date.</p>

		<p class="extend">1996 Evolution IV</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution4.jpg"><img class="index" alt="Lancer_Evolution4.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution4.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>The Lancer platform was completely changed in 1996, and along with it the Evo, which had become extremely popular throughout the world. The engine and transaxle was rotated 180° to better balance the weight and eliminate torque steer. There were 2 versions available, The RS and GSR. The RS version was produced as a competition car with a limited-slip front differential and a friction type LSD at the rear. It also came with GLX seats and 16" steel wheels as these were items that would be replaced by anyone entering the car into competition events. The RS also had wind up windows, no air conditioning-just heater, and a few extra brace bars to strengthen the chassis, one behind the front grill and the other across the boot floor. The RS also had factory thinner body panels and thinner glass! The GSR and the RS shared a new twin scroll turbocharger which helped to increase power to 280 PS (276 hp/206 kW) at 6500 rpm and 260 ft·lbf (352 Nm) of torque at 3000 rpm. Mitsubishi’s new Active YAW control appeared as a factory option on the GSR model, which used steering, throttle input sensors and G sensors to computer-hydraulically controlled torque split individually to the rear wheels and as a result the 10,000 Evo IVs produced all sold quickly. The Evo IV can be distinguished by its two large foglights on the front bumper, and the newly designed tail lights on the rear, which became a standard design to Evo VI, which would become yet another trademark of the Evolution series. This new generation was slightly heavier than previous Evos - the GSR in particular due to the added technology systems- but to counter this the car produced even more power - the Weight of the RS being 2750 lbs and the GSR being 2976 lbs. This was the only model year to use the CN9A as its frame.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="extend">1997 Evolution V</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution5.jpg"><img class="index" alt="Lancer_Evolution5.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution5.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>In 1997, the WRC created a new class, "World Rally Car", and while these cars still had to abide by Group A standards, they did not have to meet homologation rules. Mitsubishi redesigned the Evo IV with this in mind and introduced the Evo V in January of 1998.</p>
		<p>Many aspects of the car were changed such as: The interior was upgraded in the GSR version with a better class of Recaro seat. The body kit had flared arches at the front and rear and a new aluminium rear spoiler relaced the IV FRP version and gave an adjustable angle of attack to alter rear down force. The track was widened by 10 mm, the wheel offset changed from ET45 to ET38 along with the wheel diameter which rose from 16" to 17" to accommodate Brembo brakes which were added to enhance braking. In addition the brake master cylinder bore increased by 0.3 mm. The engine was strengthened in a few areas and the cam duration was increased. The pistons were lighter with a smaller skirt area. 510CC injectors were replaced with 560CC injectors for better engine reliability due to more electrical "headroom" and the ECU was changed to include a flash ROM.</p>
		<p>Further more, the turbocharger was again improved. Torque was increased to 275 ft·lbf (373 N·m) at 3000 rpm. Power officially stayed the same, at 280 PS (276 hp/206 kW) as agreed by Japan’s automotive gentlemen’s agreement that all cars would have 276 or less hp, but reputable sources claim horsepower was actually somewhat higher. Frame CP9A was used on the Evo V.</p>
		<p>Despite the changes, total weight increased only 22 pounds over the EVO IV. With an aggressive new rear wing, larger hood vents for improving radiator airflow, a deeper front chin spoiler, and enormous cooling vents in the bumper, the EVO V looked like a rolling street fight.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="extend">1999 Evolution VI</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution6.jpg"><img class="index" alt="Lancer_Evolution6.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution6.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>The Evo VI’s changes mainly focused on cooling and engine durability. It received a larger intercooler, larger oil cooler, and new pistons, along with a titanium-aluminide turbine wheel for the RS model, which was a first in a production car. Also, the Evo VI received new bodywork yet again, with the most easily spotted change in the front bumper where the huge foglights were reduced in size and moved to the corners for better airflow. A new model was added to the GSR and RS lineup; known as the RS2, it was an RS with a few of the GSR’s options. Another limited-edition RS was known as the RS Sprint, and was tuned by Ralliart to be lighter and more powerful with 330 hp.</p>
		<p>Yet another special edition Evo VI was also released in 1999: the Tommi Makinen edition, named after Finnish rally driver Tommi Makinen that had won Mitsubishi numerous WRC drivers championships. It featured Red/Black Recaro seats (with emmbosed T. Makinen logo), 17" ENKEI white wheels, a leather MOMO steering wheel and shift knob, a titanium turbine that spooled up quicker, front upper strut brace, lowered with tarmac stages in mind, a quicker lock to lock and amongst others colours, came in an exclusive shade of red with special decals, replicating Tommi Makinen’s rally car’s colour scheme. This car is also sometimes referred to as an Evo 6¹/² .</p>
		<p>It was during the Evo VI’s model run that American car enthusiasts, who had been previously denied the Evolution models, began to ask for its introduction to the United States. This was primarily due to exposure of the Evolution in movies, anime like Initial D, and video games such as the Gran Turismo series.</p>
		<p>Another trim level was introduced, RS2, combining the RS-only hardware specification with a modicum of the GSR’s niceties.</p>
		<p>The frame used for the EVO VI was CP9A on both the TME and standard edtions.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="extend">2001 Evolution VII</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution7.jpg"><img class="index" alt="Lancer_Evolution7.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution7.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>In 2001, Mitsubishi decided to race in the WRC class instead of the Group A class, and thus did not need to follow homologation rules. The Evo VII was based on the larger Lancer Cedia platform and as a result gained more weight over the Evo VI, but made up for this with multiple important chassis tweaks. The biggest change was the addition of an active center differential and a more effective limited-slip differential, while a front helical limited-slip differential was added. Torque was increased again to 284 ft·lbf (385 N·m) with engine tweaks that allowed greater airflow, and horsepower officially remained at 280 PS (276 hp/206 kW). Despite its civilian appearance, the Evolution VII can outrun many more expensive cars (such as the Ferrari 360 Modena).</p>
		<p>Most significant was the introduction of an active center differential (ACD), an all-new electro-hydraulically controlled multiplate clutch-type limited-slip differential with three times the binding capacity (783 lb-ft compared to 221 lb-ft) of the viscous unit used in the EVO VI. Active Yaw Control (AYC) still regulated torque split in the rear differential, while a torque-sensing helical limited-slip was fitted to the front. With input from a host of sensors, ACD and AYC were both regulated by a single dedicated control unit. Together, ACD and AYC improved turn-in and reduced understeer more seamlessly, allowing controlled tail-out hooliganism and scalpel-sharp steering response.</p>
		<p>Structural reinforcements to the donor Cedia chassis increased flexural rigidity by 50 percent by adding thicker sheetmetal and bracing in high-load regions, seam-welding in the B-pillars and front chassis section, and more than 200 additional spot welds in the door apertures. Weight-saving measures like thinner glass, forged aluminum suspension pieces, aluminum front fenders, thinner sheetmetal in the roof panel, a magnesium cam cover, and hollow camshafts kept the total vehicle weight increase to about 90 pounds over the EVO VI.</p>
		<p>At 276 hp, quoted power remained unchanged though peak torque increased to 283 lb-ft, this time by way of reworked intake ports, a less-restrictive intake manifold, and a smaller twin-scroll turbine housing (reduced from 10.5 to 9.8 cm2). Paired with a 20mm larger intercooler and a lower-backpressure exhaust, the sauce was spread over a broader range of engine speeds than ever before. Overall, the VII was an even more potent performer-if a more civilized one-than the VI.</p>
		<p>The frame used was frame:CT9A, which is the currently used frame on all Evolutions manufactured currently.</p>

		<p class="extend">2003 Evolution VIII</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution8.jpg"><img class="index" alt="Lancer_Evolution8.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution8.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>The Evolution was changed again in 2003, this time sporting Super Active Yaw Control to handle traction and a 6-speed manual gearbox. It was available with 280 PS (276 hp/206 kW) in three trims: standard (GSR in Japan), RS (devoid of all excess components, such as the rear wing, trunk carpeting, interior map lights, power windows/doors, and radio) and MR, which came with a new vortex generator (a set of ridges above the rear window to improve aerodynamics). Both RS and MR Editions came with a revised limited-slip front differential.</p>
		<p>The Lancer Evolution VIII MR uses slick-response Bilstein shocks for improved handling. The aluminum roof panel and other reductions in body weight have lowered the centre of gravity to realize more natural roll characteristics. Detail improvements have also been made to Mitsubishi’s own electronic all-wheel drive, to the ACD 5 + Super AYC 6 traction control and to the Sports ABS systems. The Lancer Evolution VIII displayed at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show took the MR designation traditionally reserved for Mitsubishi Motors high-performance models and used first on the Galant GTO. Other parts on the MR include BBS alloy wheels, Recaro bucket seats, Brembo brakes, and a MOMO steering wheel</p>
		<p>In the United Kingdom, many special Evolutions were introduced, which included FQ320, FQ340, and FQ400 variants (FQ said jocularly to stand for ’Fucking Quick’). They each came with 320, 340, and 400 hp (239, 254, and 298 kW), respectively.</p>
		<p>The FQ400, sold through Ralliart UK, produces 302.13 kW (405.2 hp), from its 2.0 L 4G63 engine as the result of being specially modified by United Kingdom tuning firms Rampage, Owen Developments and Flow Race Engines. At 202.9 hp (151.3 kW) per litre, it has one of the highest specific output per litre of any roadcar engine. With a curb weight of around 3200 lb, it achieves a 0-60 in 3.5 seconds and a 0-100 in around 9 seconds, while costing about £47,000. BBC’s television series Top Gear demonstrated that the FQ-400 could easily keep up with a Lamborghini Murcielago around a test track. The Stig recorded a Top Gear Power Lap Times of 1 minute 24.8 seconds.</p>
		<p>The Lancer Evolution VIII was also the first Evolution to come to the United States, spurred by the success of the Subaru Impreza WRX which had been released there just three years prior. However, the internal components for the American versions were based largely on the specifications for the Japanese Lancer Evolution VII. No US-spec Evolution has active yaw control, including the 2006 Evolution IX. The American 2003 and 2004 GSRs are without the helical limited-slip front differential and 6-speed manual transmission. The 2004 US spec RS model, however, does have a front helical limited-slip differential. All 2003, 2004 and 2005 RS and GSR models have the Japanese Evolution VII’s 5-speed transmission. The MR edition was introduced to the US in 2004, the first model to sport the ACD and still (as of 2006) the only model with a 6-speed transmission. The 2005 US spec RS and GSR have the ACD standard, and the front helical limited-slip differential is now standard on all models. The timing and tuning are also slightly lower than its Japanese counterpart, allowing it to adhere to the strict emissions regulations of the United States.</p>
		<p>Most Evolution VIIIs have a carbon fiber rear spoiler with matching body-color endplates, except for the MR Edition, whose endplates are painted black. The basic RS Edition does not come with a rear spoiler.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="extend">2006 Evolution IX</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution9.jpg"><img class="index" alt="Lancer_Evolution9.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution9.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>Mitsubishi introduced the 2006 Lancer Evolution IX at the 2005 New York International Auto Show. The 2.0 L 4G63 engine got MIVEC technology (variable valve timing), boosting official power output to 286 hp (213 kW) and torque to 289 ft·lbf (392 N·m) - however actual figures are significantly higher. The Evolution VIII first offered in 2003 would produce dynamometer readings of approximately 225 WHP and 225 ft-lbs. WTQ with a flywheel power rating of 271/273 respectively. The Evolution IX typically pulls 255 WHP and 250 WTQ on a dynamometer, a difference of 30 horsepower, not even taking into consideration the drivetrain losses.</p>
		<p>The Lancer Evolution IX models (RS,IX,MR) vary in their performance capabilities. Subtleties unique to each model account for variations in acceleration, handling and top speed. The decontented RS is the purist’s car, reaching 60 mph in a mere 4.4 seconds, compared to 4.5 for the slightly heavier IX and MR models (which have power windows, rear spoilers, and Xenon lights). Weight savings of over 60 pounds give the RS a subtly sharper handling responsiveness that helps it shave fractions of a second off the lap times of the IX and MR on an identical course. The premium price of the top-model MR is not spent in vain if speed is a priority, as the MR’s 6th forward gear allows it to reach 165 mph at 7,000 rpm compared to 157 at 7,000 in 5th for the RS and middle-positioned IX models. (Note: Data relevant to U.S. model specifications)</p>
		<p>The IX keeps all the Evolution VIII MR goodies like Bilstein shocks, a 6-speed manual transmission, vortex generators, BBS alloy wheels, Recaro bucket seats, Brembo brakes, MOMO steering wheel, and an aluminium roof. Additional revisions from 2005 include a closer gear ratio for the 5-speed transmission, new lighter Enkei wheels on non-MR models, a redesigned front end, a more efficient air dam (the most noticeable feature are the two small oval ducts to cool the intercooler pipes) and new rear bumper with a diffuser undersurface to smooth out the airflow coming out of the car</p>

		<p class="extend">2007 Evolution X</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="Lancer_Evolution10.jpg"><img class="index" alt="1993 Lancer Evolution10.jpg" src="Lancer_Evolution10.jpg" width="280" height="179"></a>The Lancer Evo X was possibly a bigger step on from its predecessor than any other model in the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution series. For the first time, there was an entirely new engine, with the internal code 4B11T. Like previous Evos, the unit was still a 2-litre, turbocharged inline four, but the cylinder block was cast aluminium rather than cast iron. It was 12kg lighter as a result, used a timing chain rather than a belt, and featured MIVEC valve-timing for both intake and exhaust valves, rather than just the intake.</p>
		<p>While some previous Evos were offered with an automatic transmission, it was a much bigger feature with the Evo X. The dual-clutch unit, dubbed TC SST (for Twin Clutch Sports Shift Transmission), featured six ratios and enabled the 276bhp X (in Japanese trim) to reach 62mh in 5.2sec, despite a 1540kg kerb weight, 140kg more than the IX it replaced.</p>
		<p>As ever, this was countered to a degree by a collection of clever electronic systems, all rolled under the S-AWC (Super All Wheel Control) banner, which incorporated Active Yaw Control, an active centre diff, the stability control system, and ABS. The X was also 30mm wider of track than the IX, 40 per cent stiffer in torsional rigidity, and the new engine wasn’t just lighter, but positioned 10 per cent lower in the engine bay.</p>
		<p>Other models soon followed - evo drove the FQ-330, FQ-360 and insane FQ-400 over the years (making 200bhp/litre), as well as a hardcore RS model. Given it also arrived at the same time as the disappointing hatchback-based Impreza, its appeal was always assured.</p>
